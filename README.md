## OpenDataBeta
With funding from the Harvard School of Design Service Fellowship, in collaboration with City Councillor Nadeem Mazen and his design firm, Nimblebot, I developed a suite of software tools for strengthening municipal civic engagement. We did intensive user research with civil society organizations and ultimately created tools that allow them to easily pull data from government websites and deliver it to their constituencies via low-touch, high-engagement channels, such as SMS, with almost no technical volunteer labor.
